## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the delivery times of Zomato orders. Accurate delivery time predictions can help enhance customer satisfaction and streamline delivery operations.


## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. The following steps are performed:
- Removal of duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights. Key steps include:
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features that can improve model performance. Steps include:
- Time-based features (e.g., hour of day, day of week)
- Interaction features
- Aggregation features

## Modeling

Various machine learning models are implemented and compared, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness.

## Results

The results section highlights the performance of different models and identifies the best-performing model. Visualizations of model predictions and actual delivery times are included.

## Conclusions

This section summarizes the key findings, discusses the implications, and suggests potential improvements for future work.
